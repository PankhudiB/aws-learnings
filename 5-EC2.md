EC2 sizing & conf 

    OS -> linux,mac,windows

        - n/w attached 
        - h/w attached
    n/w card -> 
    what type of public IP u want ?
    firewall rules -> security group
    bootstrap script available -> ec2 user data --> automate boot task
        - install updates , s/w , anything while boot time of machine
        - runs with root user
    diff EC2 instance type -> like micro,xlarge ... increasing CPU , mem, storage, n/w bandwidth, ebs bandwidth
