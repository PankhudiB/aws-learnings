##EC2 Basics

elastic cloud compute -- IAAS

renting virtual machines (EC2)
storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
distribute load across machines -(ELB)
scaling services using auto scaling group (ASG)

EC2 sizing & conf 

    OS -> linux,mac,windows
    CPU
    RAM
    how much storage attached ?
        - n/w attached 
        - h/w attached
    n/w card -> 
    what type of public IP u want ?
    firewall rules -> security group
    bootstrap script available -> ec2 user data --> automate boot task
        - install updates , s/w , anything while boot time of machine
        - runs with root user
    diff EC2 instance type -> like micro,xlarge ... increasing CPU , mem, storage, n/w bandwidth, ebs bandwidth


- Make sure to add http security group to be able to talk to the instance via http. 
- Also create a new key pair & download the RSA private key b4 launching the instance

- Every time you stop and restart EC2 instance -> its public IP changes, private IP remains the same.
